<h1>Welcome to my Resume Page</h1>

<hr/>
<p>I'm creating this page as a small first HTML project to practice what I learnt.<br/>
It's not going to look pretty, as I don't have any knowledge in CSS yet.</p>

<h3>Education:</h3>
<img src="./assets/images/education.jpg" alt="Image of a Hat" height="150"/>
<p>Currently, I'm doing an apprenticeship as a junior dev.<br/>
03-2020 - 09-2023, I studied computer science, I didn't finish my degree though.<br/>
09-2016 - 07-2019, I went to a technical college in Regensburg. (A-Level: 2,4)<br/>
I could list further previous education here, but I don't feel like it adds too much.</p>
<hr/>

<h3>Work Experience:</h3>
<p>Due to my apprenticeship, I get a lot of experience in coding right now.<br/>
During 2016 and 2017 I had two internships, one at Netto, and the other at a small IT company.<br/>
I was able to take a peek into C# and PHP during that time.</p>
